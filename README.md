## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this i was able to write the code myself to reveal the answers, it was a long one with seperate code for each answer (there are 4), but it was working, but to change the image i need to ask gemini, i remenber in bit and pieces how to do it, but can't put together, but i know i can do that again on my own in next challenges, if there was nothing new to do, but i hope it does.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
